# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.

## Database

- **Database Dialect**: The database dialect is set in the `nuxt.config.ts` file, within the `hub.db` option or `hub.db.dialect` property.
- **Drizzle Config**: Don't generate the `drizzle.config.ts` file manually, it is generated automatically by NuxtHub.
- **Generate Migrations**: Use `npx nuxt db generate` to automatically generate database migrations from schema changes
- **Never Write Manual Migrations**: Do not manually create SQL migration files in the `server/db/migrations/` directory
- **Workflow**:
  1. Create or modify the database schema in `server/db/schema.ts` or any other schema file in the `server/db/schema/` directory
  2. Run `npx nuxt db generate` to generate the migration
  3. Run `npx nuxt db migrate` to apply the migration to the database, or run `npx nuxt dev` to apply the migration during development
- **Access the database**: Use the `db` instance from `@nuxthub/db` (or `hub:db` for backwards compatibility) to query the database, it is a Drizzle ORM instance.
